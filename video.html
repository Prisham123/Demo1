<h2>The septet's name, BTS, stands for the Korean phrase Bangtan Sonyeondan (Korean: 방탄소년단; Hanja: 防彈少年團), which translates literally to "Bulletproof Boy Scouts". According to member J-Hope, the name signifies the group's desire "to block out stereotypes, criticisms, and expectations that aim on adolescents like bullets".[2][3] In Japan, they are known as Bōdan Shōnendan (防弾少年団).[4] In July 2017, BTS announced that their name would also stand for "Beyond the Scene" as part of their new brand identity.[5] This extended the meaning of their name to encompass the idea of growth "from a boy to an adult who opens the doors that are facing forward".[6]</h2>

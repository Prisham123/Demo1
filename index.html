The septet—consisting of members Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook—co-writes and co-produces much of their own material. Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to incorporate a wide range of genres; their lyrics often discuss mental health, the troubles of school-age youth and coming of age, loss, the journey towards self-love, and individualism.</t></th>

<h1>BLACKPINK and BTS</h1>
<t style="font-size:20px;">The BTS boyband and the Blackpink girls are currently two of the leading K-pop groups in the world at the moment and when it comes to fame and popularity, both of them are pretty much evens-stevens with each other. While Blackpink is helmed by the amazing gang of talented people like Jisoo, Jennie, Lisa & Rose, spearheading the BTS boyband are the likes of Jungkook, Jimin, Suga, V and J-Hope.
 Both the bands enjoy a humongous fan following all over the world and when it comes to fans wishing that they do a collaboration soon, the request hasn’t been heard so far. But recently, there emerged reports on Twitter of both the bands apparently collaborating in 2021. So is that true? 
Well no readers, that’s not true as so far, we have no confirmation from Blackpink, BTS or Big Hit Entertainment regarding the same and hence we request you not to believe fake rumors.</t>

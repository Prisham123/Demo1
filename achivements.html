<marquee><h1 style="color:pink;">A Timeline of BTS'S History-Making Accomplishments</h1></marquee>
<t style="font-size:20px;">2018 has been an extremely fruitful year for BTS as they have achieved many awards for their music and also become one of the most influential people to date. Gaining even more international coverage from Rolling Stone, Forbes, Vogue, CNN and so on , BTS is bound to step up higher than before, causing their fans to just wonder how much more they are going to take over the K-Pop industry.

    After releasing their third full length album "LOVE YOURSELF: Tear" in May, one of the biggest events that happened to BTS is most probably their world premiere of 'FAKE LOVE' performance on Billboard Music Awards 2018 (BBMAs). In addition to that, they had also claimed the 'Top Social Artist' award twice in a row, since 2017.
